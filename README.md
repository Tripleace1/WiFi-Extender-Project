# WiFi-Extender-Project
This project successfully created a cost-effective WiFi extender using the ESP32 and NAT router firmware, significantly improving coverage in weak signal areas. Future enhancements could optimize performance and further extend the range.


# Introduction
The objective of this project was to create a WiFi extender using the ESP32 microcontroller and NAT router firmware. A WiFi extender is a device that helps improve the coverage area of a WiFi network by receiving the existing WiFi signal, amplifying it, and then transmitting the boosted signal. This project aims to provide a cost-effective and efficient solution to extend WiFi coverage in areas with weak signal strength.

# Objectives
The primary objectives of this project were:
1.To configure the ESP32 as a WiFi extender.
2.To use NAT router firmware to enable the ESP8266 to bridge the connection between two networks.
3.To ensure a stable and reliable connection that extends the WiFi coverage area.

# Materials:
ESP32 Development Board

NAT router firmware (cloned an opensource repository)

# Methods:
Hardware Setup
Firmware Installation
Network Configuration
Testing

# Results
The WiFi extender project using ESP32 and NAT router firmware was successful. The ESP32 was able to connect to the existing WiFi network and extend the signal effectively thereby making it one of the cheapest solution that can be commercialized.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrated the feasibility of using the ESP32 microcontroller with NAT router firmware to create a cost-effective WiFi extender. The extender significantly improved WiFi coverage in weak signal areas, providing a stable and reliable connection. Challenges included initial configuration and ensuring the ESP32 maintained a consistent connection.
